readable.c takes either one or zero arguments.

If one argument is passed it assumes it to be a 
pathname (relative or absolute). If no argument 
is passed the pathname of the present directory
is assumed.

Readable recursively traverses all subdirectories
of the pathname passed, starting with the pathname
and lists every file that is readable by the
current process.

Symbolic links are not followed but a note is 
printed to STDOUT listing the name.

To Compile:
makefile is included in readable.tar.gz; however,
gcc -std=c99 readable.c -o read
will compile an executable in the current
directory.

To Execute:
./read 
or ./read <pathname>

File list:
readable.c
makefile
