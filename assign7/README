Dining Philosophers (POSIX semaphores)

Description:
Solves the Dining Philosophers problem for N (5) philosophers using POSIX semaphores. Philosophers begin by thinking. Some philosophers will reach for their left chopstick first while others will reach for their right chopstick first. 
f[id & 1] = (id + 1) % N;
A status message is displayed each time a phiosopher eats of thinks with the id number (0-4) and number of time units spent on the activity. When a philosopher has eaten at least 100 units they leave the table (thread closes).
