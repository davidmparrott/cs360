Assignment 8
Date/Time server/client

description:
Two programs have been written. One (dayserve) opens a socket on a port specified by MY_PORT_NUMBER
and awaits a connection. The other (daytime) connects to a remote host specified by the user on
the command line eg ./daytime 127.0.0.1. When dayserve opens a connection it spawns a child process 
that gets the date/time data and writes it to the socket. This child process dies after it writes.
The parent continues to listen for more connections. After daytime receives data it outputs whatever
it received to STDOUT and terminates.

to compile: 
make all

to execute:
to execute dayserve ./dayserve
to execute daytime  ./daytime <remote host>

to terminate:
daytime will terminate after completion
dayserve must be terminated with ctrl-c
